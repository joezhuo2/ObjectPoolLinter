# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.1.0]

### Added
- Detection of array allocations in hot paths: `SyntaxKind.ArrayCreationExpression`
  (`new int[10]`) and `SyntaxKind.ImplicitArrayCreationExpression` (`new[] { 1, 2 }`).
- Detection of target-typed `new()` allocations:
  `SyntaxKind.ImplicitObjectCreationExpression` (`List<int> x = new();`).

### Changed
- `AnalyzeObjectCreation` generalised to `AnalyzeAllocation`, handling every allocating
  syntax kind through a single registration.
- Allocated type name in the diagnostic message is now resolved per syntax kind, falling
  back to the semantic type in minimally-qualified form for implicit forms.
- Value-type filtering no longer suppresses arrays of value types, so `new int[10]` is
  reported.

### Removed
- Empty placeholder test `tests/ObjectPoolLinter.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.
